> Notes:
>
> - <sup> **1**. Your repository name and your Github username are **NOT** the same thing.</sup>
> - <sup> **2**. I should be able to click your repo link, and it will take me to your course repository. NOT your github home page.
> - <sup> **3**. Uploading an image of you (with your face in it) will help me learn names faster!</sup>
