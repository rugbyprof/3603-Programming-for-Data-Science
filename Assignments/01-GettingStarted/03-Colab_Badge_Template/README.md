# 📘 03 - Colab Badge Template

Once your notebook is in GitHub, you can create a badge to launch it in Colab directly from your README or docs.

---

## 🏷️ Badge Template

```markdown
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/blob/main/PATH/TO/NOTEBOOK.ipynb)
```

---

## ✏️ Replace:
- `YOUR_USERNAME` → your GitHub username  
- `YOUR_REPO` → your repository name  
- `PATH/TO/NOTEBOOK.ipynb` → exact notebook path  

---

## ✅ Example

```markdown
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexsmith/data-science-notebooks/blob/main/week1_intro.ipynb)
```

Paste that in your README and it becomes a launch button!
