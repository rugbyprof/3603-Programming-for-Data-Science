# 📘 Intro to Python: Programming for Data Science

Welcome! This is the start of your journey into Python and Data Science.

This folder contains beginner-friendly Jupyter Notebooks to help you learn:

- Python syntax and logic
- Working with data using lists, dictionaries, and variables
- How to run and modify code in the cloud using **Google Colab** or **Binder**
- How to integrate GitHub into your coding workflow

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ 1. Start Here on D2L

Go to the assignment posted in **D2L**. It contains:

- A direct link to this folder
- Instructions on how to view, run, and submit notebooks

---

### 🔍 2. Find the Right Notebook

Open one of the learning notebooks below:

| Notebook                                               | Description                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`00_IntroNotebook.ipynb`](00_IntroNotebook.ipynb)     | Getting started with code, markdown, and Jupyter cells |
| [`01_BasicMath.ipynb`](01_BasicMath.ipynb)             | Python as a calculator: operators, order, variables    |
| [`02_ListsAndStrings.ipynb`](02_ListsAndStrings.ipynb) | Learn about lists, indexing, slicing, and strings      |
| [`03_Dictionaries.ipynb`](03_Dictionaries.ipynb)       | Use key-value pairs to store and retrieve data         |

### ☁️ 3. Run the Notebook Online

No installation needed! Pick one of the following options:

#### 🔹 Run in Google Colab (Recommended)

Click the badge below to open in Colab:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rugbyprof/3603-Programming-for-Data-Science/blob/main/Books/Intro2Python/00_IntroNotebook.ipynb)

> 📌 Tip: Once it opens, click **File > Save a Copy in Drive** to save your own version.

#### 🔸 Run in Binder (Temporary Environment)

If you prefer a full Jupyter experience:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rugbyprof/3603-Programming-for-Data-Science/HEAD?filepath=Books%2FIntro2Python%2F00_IntroNotebook.ipynb)

---

### ✏️ 4. Edit and Complete

Work through the notebook:

- Run code cells (Shift+Enter)
- Edit markdown explanations
- Answer questions and complete exercises

---

### 📤 5. Turn In Your Work

You have two options:

- ✅ **Colab Users**:

  - Click **Share** in the top right
  - Change permissions to “Anyone with the link”
  - Paste the link into your assignment on D2L

- ✅ **Download and Upload**:
  - Click **File > Download > .ipynb**
  - Upload the file to D2L

### 🧠 Next Steps

As you work through these notebooks, you'll:

- Build Python fluency
- Learn how GitHub fits into modern coding workflows
- Prepare for real data science tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib

Let’s get started!
```

Would you like me to:

1. **Create a version with badges for all 4 notebooks**?
2. **Update each individual notebook with intro text and submission reminders**?
3. Generate a **"first week" assignment notebook** that actually walks through GitHub/Colab/Binder hands-on?

Let me know what’s next and I’ll jump on it.
