# ðŸ“˜ Appendix: List Comprehensions and Generators

This appendix introduces two Python features for working with sequences and data more efficiently: **List Comprehensions** and **Generators**.

---

## âœ… Learning Goals

- Understand the syntax and purpose of list comprehensions
- Learn how to filter or transform lists using a single line of code
- Understand the difference between generators and lists
- Use `yield` to build custom generators
- Decide when to use a comprehension vs a generator

---

## ðŸ¤” When Should You Use These?

| Goal | Use This |
|------|----------|
| You want a new list based on an existing list | **List comprehension** |
| You want to loop through items one at a time without storing them all at once | **Generator** |
| Youâ€™re filtering or transforming data | **Comprehension** |
| Youâ€™re reading large files or datasets | **Generator** |
